Project Overview:

This project processes and analyzes lung cancer patient survey responses using custom hash tables in Java. It includes parsing input data, storing it efficiently, and performing statistical analyses across demographic and health-related categories.

Task Division:

Asilbek Ismatilloev â€“ Task 4 (65%)
Developed methods for analysing data given in table format. Methods were following hash table usage.
Using trial and error methods developed 20 methods according to the criteria that output expected results given from our professor. Avoided using uncovered material, and sometimes methods were interconnected to each other.

David Yen - Task 1,2,3 (45%)
Response: Create a Response class to represent each individual survey response with all necessary fields, a constructor, accessor methods, and a method to display demographic information.
CustomHashTable: Modify the provided CustomHashTable class to store Response objects instead of String values and increase the table's default capacity from 10 to 100.
ReadFile: Implement a method to read survey responses from a text file and load them into the custom hash table.
